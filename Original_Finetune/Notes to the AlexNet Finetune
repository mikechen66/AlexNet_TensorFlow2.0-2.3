The script is an opportunity for users to learn from the classical model of AlexNet.The self-contained 
script includes most of the lines of code of myalexnet_forward_tf2.py updated by the editor. It is a 
headache that almost all the available alexnet finetune script found in Google could not be run or executed 
to generate many errors.  It paves the way for users to have a continuous attention on the AlexNet model 
and bridge between the past, the present and the future. There are some prerequisites as follows. 

1.Download bvlc_alexnet.npy

http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/bvlc_alexnet.npy

2.Download dogs-vs-cats data from Kaggle and unzip into a fileholder such as AlexNet-Finetune

https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

3.Put the script into the fileholder and then execute the script
$ cd /home/user/Documents/AlexNet_Finetune

$ python3 finetune_functional.py 

It will run iterations and show a picture.
