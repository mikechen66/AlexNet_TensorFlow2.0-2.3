Introduction to usage of ILSVRC dataset

The goal of this Imagenet competition is to estimate the content of photographs for the purpose of 
retrieval and automatic annotation using a subset of the large hand-labeled ImageNet dataset 
(10,000,000 labeled images depicting 10,000+ object categories) as training. Test images will be 
presented with no initial annotation -- no segmentation or labels -- and algorithms will have to 
produce labelings specifying what objects are present in the images. New test images will be 
collected and labeled especially for this competition and are not part of the previously published 
ImageNet dataset. T

he general goal is to identify the main objects present in images. To use the script in Python, 
users need to create the folder such as AlexNet_ILSVRC. Users need to do the following actions to 
run the script. 

1.Download ILSVRC2012 Dataset

# Download the dataset 

Please donwloand the ILSVRC dataset in the public dataset. Either get the dataset by registering in 
the the official website or get the dataset via the dataset search. Since it has 150GB, users need 
to download it in a very long time. It is very big but an exciting momment for users to access to 
the big data.

# Unzip

After unzipping the ILSVRC datasets, please do the following actions to adapt the scripts. 

Change the original filenames
 
ILSVRC2012_bbox_train_v2, ILSVRC2012_img_test, ILSVRC2012_img_train, ILSVRC2012_img_val

to the new filenames as follows 

bbox_train_v2, img_test, img_train, img_val

2. Enter into current directory

$ cd /home/user/Documents/Alexnet_ILSVRC

Anaconda defaults the pre-installed Python3 and the Ubuntu 18.04 has both Python2 and Python3. Therefore, 
users need to follow the procedures. 

3. Script running command

In the Conda Environment, please execute the following command in the Ubuntu terminal at the current 
directory.  

# Train the model from scrach

$ python train.py /home/user/datasets/ILSVRC2012 --resume False --train true
